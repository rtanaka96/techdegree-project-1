        <h2>Art & Design</h2>
        <p>I'm a self-trained freelance illustrator, and have always had a passion for art and graphic design! I enjoy creating and have been having fun putting my burgeoning knowledge of front-end web development to use.</p>

        <h2>Coding</h2>
        <p>In high school, I used FreeCodeAcademy to teach myself HTML, CSS, and JS (as well as jQuery). I continued this in college with a couple of CompSci classes, but ended up pursuing a psychology degree instead due to feeling out of place in the largely white and male CS classes my university offered. Today I am rediscovering my enjoyment of coding!</p>

        <h2>Video Games</h2>
        <p>Although most of the games I play are limited to Nintendo games like Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild or Animal Crossing New Horizons, I enjoy winding down with a nice comfy video game after a long day of work or study and getting to be creative, solve fun and engaging puzzles, and immerse myself in rich — or sometimes just plain playful — narratives.</p>

        <h2>Astrology</h2>
        <p>Though by no means an expert in the field, I enjoy reading astrology books and learning about horoscopes! Whether or not one believes in astrology, it offers a small moment in time to really reflect on oneself and one's position, in life and in the stars, and I find that to be cathartic.</p>
